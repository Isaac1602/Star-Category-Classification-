# Star-Category-Classification-
This project focuses on classifying stars based on various physical properties such as temperature, luminosity, radius, and spectral class. The goal is to build a model that can predict the category of a star using machine learning techniques.

## Features of the Dataset:
- **Temperature** (K): Surface temperature of the star.
- **Luminosity** (L/Lo): Energy output of the star compared to the Sun.
- **Radius** (R/Ro): Relative size compared to the Sun.
- **Absolute Magnitude** (Mv): Logarithmic measure of true brightness.
- **Star Type**: The type of star based on its life stage and nuclear fusion process.
- **Star Color**: Indicates the star's emitted wavelength, correlated with temperature.
- **Spectral Class**: Classification based on absorption lines in the star's spectrum.
## Project Goals:
- Clean and preprocess the star dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships among features.
- Train machine learning models to classify stars into different categories.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
## Tools and Libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation and wrangling.
- NumPy for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning model implementation.
